# ðŸš€ Project Template

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is a standardized, but flexible *project* and *documentation* structure of folders and files for sharing your data science work.

Inspired by [literate programming](http://literateprogramming.com) and [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/), maintained by the [World Bank Development Data Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec#2) and built as [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> contains:

- **README**, **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**, **CONTRIBUTING**
    > README files are important and often neglected. The files should inform anyone about about the first steps to use, learn and contribute to your project.

- **LICENSE**
  > The LICENSE is a document that  determines what others can and cannot do with contents of the repository. If no license is present, no one has permission to use and/or modify your code.

- [Issues and Pull Requests GitHub templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)
    > GitHub allows to customize how issues and pull requests are presented to the public. Custom templates encourage collaboration and maintainability.

- **docs/**

    > Documentation is often never priotized until last minute. The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> aims to revert the malpractice by setting up the documentation as an integral part of the code repository. With the power of [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org), data practioners have a way to share [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) in a standardized and effortless way.

- **data/**
    > Placeholder folder for data. Data is immutable. By default, the data folder is present but ignored from version control, in order to prevent files of being mistakenly versioned in the code repository.

- **src/**
    > Placeholder folder for source code. If Python, it is recommended the package is made pip-installable.

- **notebooks/**
    > Placeholder folder for [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org). Markdown files and Jupyter notebooks can be added to `docs/_toc.yml` (Table of Contents) to compose the *documentation*.

```{important}
Admittedly, even the best of the templates would never be perfect; the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> aims to encourage teams to start thinking and assimilate **best practices**, **collaborative coding**, **documentation**â€‹, **reproducibilityâ€‹** as an integral part of the project. *In a standardized way*.

In this spirit, in case you have feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/worldbank/template/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/worldbank/template/pulls) to share your ideas and suggestions.
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

```{margin} âœ¨ Can't see the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> ?
Please ensure you are logged in on [GitHub](https://github.com) and have permissions to create a repository.
```

1. **Create new repository from template**

    The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is a [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template); in other words, you can generate a new GitHub repository with the same files and folders to use as the starting point for your project.

    > ðŸŒŸ [Create new repository from **template**](https://github.com/worldbank/template/generate)

    ```{figure} docs/images/github-template.png
    ---
    ---
    ```

    Now, give your repository a name, choose the **visibility** (Public or Private) and click **Create repository from template**.

    ```{figure} docs/images/github-template-create.png
    ---
    ---
    ```

    *VoilÃ !* The repository has been created with the same files and folders of the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span>.

    ```{seealso}
    For additional information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
    ```

2. **Enable and Publish via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)**

    After creating the repository from the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span>, a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) will be automatically built from the `main` branch and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

    ```{figure} docs/images/github-template-action.png
    ---
    ---
    ```

    To publish the *documentation*, please enable [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) by going to the repository's settings (`Settings > Pages`), and selecting to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

    ```{figure} docs/images/github-template-pages.png
    ---
    ---
    ```

    ```{tip}
    The *documentation* can be published from either *public* and *private* repositories. If publishing private content, please remember to carefully select the content to be made public and to abide by your organization's Data Privacy Policy.
    ```

3. **Update configurations**

    The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> comes with a default `docs/_config.yml` Jupyter Book configuration file. Remember to update it to reflect your project's name and details.

      ```
      repository:
      url: https://github.com/worldbank/template
      branch: main
      ```

    In case your project uses Python, it is *strongly* recommended distributing it as a [package](https://packaging.python.org/).

    ```{tip}
    The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> contains an example - the [datalab](https://github.com/worldbank/template/tree/main/src/datalab) Python package - and will automatically find and install any `src` packages as long as `setup.cfg` is kept up-to-date.
    ```

   ```{seealso}

    [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/)
    ```

4. **Review and update README files**

    The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> comes with README files - including [this **README**](README) - that should provide anyone with the information about the first steps to use, learn and contribute to your project. Please **replace** and/or **repurpose** the files with instructions and detailed information about your project.

    > - **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**
    > - **CONTRIBUTING**
    > - **README**
    > - Issues and Pull Requests GitHub templates

    ```{seealso}

    ```

5. **Choose a license**

    A LICENSE is the document that guarantees the repository can be shared, modified and receive contributions. Otherwise, if no license is present, all rights are reserved. The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is licensed under the [**World Bank Master Community License Agreement**](LICENSE); if necessary, choose a different license for your project.

    ```{seealso}

### Adding Content

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> is created as a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) - an open-source project to build beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational content. Let's see below how to add, execute and publish new content for your project.

#### Table of Contents

When ready to publish the *documentation* on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), all you need to do is edit the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) and add and/or update content you would like to display. [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) supports content written as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks and [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) files and the `docs/_toc.yml` file controls the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) of your book.

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> comes with the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) below as an example.

```
format: jb-book
root: README

parts:
  - caption: Documentation
    numbered: True
    chapters:
    - file: notebooks/world-bank-api.ipynb
  - caption: Additional Resources
    chapters:
      - url: https://datapartnership.org
        title: Development Data Partnership
      - url: https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec
        title: World Bank DEC
      - url: https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime
        title: World Bank DIME
```

```{seealso}
[Jupyter Book Structure and organize content](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/basics/organize.html)
```

#### Dependencies

The next step is ensure your code is maintainable, realiable and reproducible by including
any dependencies and requirements, such as packages, configurations, secrets (template) and addtional instructions.

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> uses [conda](https://docs.conda.io/) as environment manager and, as [conventional](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), the environment is controlled by the `environment.yml` file.

The `environment.yml` file is where you specify any packages available on the [Anaconda repository](https://anaconda.org) as well as from the Anaconda Cloud (including [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org)) to install for your project. Ensure to include the pinned version of packages required by your project (including by Jupyter notebooks).

```
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - bokeh=2.4.3
  - pandas=1.4.3
  - pip:
    - requests==2.28.1
```

To (re)create the environment on your installation of [conda](https://conda.io) via [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) or preferably [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), you only need to pass the `environment.yml` file, which will install requirements and guarantee that whoever uses your code has the necessary packages (and correct versions). By default, the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> uses [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org).

```
conda env create -n <your-environment-name> -f environment.yml
```

```{seealso}
[Conda Managing Environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
```

#### Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) can be beautifully rendered and downloaded from your book. [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) will execute notebooks during the build (on GitHub) and display **code outputs** and **interactive visualizations** as part of the *documentation* on the fly. By default, the <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> will execute any files listed on the [table of contents](#table-of-contents) that have a notebook structure.

The <span style="color:#3EACAD">template</span> comes with a Jupyter notebook example, `notebooks/world-bank-api.ipynb`, to illustrate.

```{important}
**All** Jupyter notebooks will be executed by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) during build on each commit to the `main` branch. Thus, it is important to include all [requirements and dependencies](#dependencies) in the repository. In case you would like to ignore a notebook, you can [exclude files from execution](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/content/execute.html#exclude-files-from-execution).
```
